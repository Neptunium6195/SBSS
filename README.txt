This is a website that lists volunteer oppurtunities (intentionally for High Schoolers) in the South Bay area. Feel free to use this as a template to create a website for your own community. 
The purpose of this project is to promote volunteering for high school students to foster a better community. Personally, I couldn't find many opportunities but when I did find one I learned that they lacked volunteers and support. Thus, I created this site.
I created this project using the ZeroFour template from HTML5 UP, replaced the contents, modified the overall layout to best suit the purpose of the website, and created a filtering algorithm.
In the beginning I had no idea how to read CSS, there was so much code and I had a very hard time finding which sections of HTML code correlated with each section of HTML. But after a lot of researching, modifying values to see correlations, and searching (with ctrl+f) I was able to understand more and more CSS. I ran into another problem with the CSS when I wanted to redo the layout of a section. So I researched image style parameters and found out about flex-groups which were able to resize my images despite the size of the window.

A responsive general purpose site template design named as such because it's the fourth
design up here (very creative I know). Has plenty of room for all sorts of content
and even multilevel drop down menus.
